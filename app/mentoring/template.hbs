      The EmberSherpa mentoring service is a structured way to train individual developers to become technical leaders within the organization. In the beginning of this process, we introduce your developer to an experienced mentor whoâ€™ll guide your developer in building skills necessary to effectively lead a technical team.

      Our mentoring services are designed to help both junior and senior level developers. We assign specific mentors based on the current need of your team. With our mentoring service, you get access to the entire EmberSherpa team.
