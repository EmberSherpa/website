      EmberSherpa training is designed to teach participants how to write a complete Ember application using Test Driven Development. Our training consists of a series of workshops that incrementally build studentâ€™s understanding of each aspect of an Ember application.
    </p>
    <p>
      In test driven fashion, we start with writing tests to be describe how an aspect of the application behaves, followed by a simple implementation with Ember APIs and we finish by refactoring the same code to use the best special purpose community addon.
